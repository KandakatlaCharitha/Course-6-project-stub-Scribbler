Welcome to mini blogging website project! 
This repository contains the code for a dynamic blogging platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project follows a structured folder hierarchy to maintain organization and clarity. 
The "index.html" file serves as the homepage, featuring a user-friendly interface with sign-up and sign-in modal functionalities. 
Additionally, the project includes pages for listing all posts and displaying individual posts, complete with editing capabilities, likes,
and comments. We've incorporated Bootstrap for responsive design, FontAwesome for icons, and Google Fonts for typography.
Each feature is implemented in a modular fashion, with separate CSS and JavaScript files for easy maintenance and scalability.
